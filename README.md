## Install

```
pip install homotopy && apm install homotopy
```

Homotopy atom plugin can be installed through
[Atom](https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/atom-packages/).
In that case, Homotopy engine still needs to be installed separately.

``` bash
pip install homotopy #you might need to use pip3 instead
```
